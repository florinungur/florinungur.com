    <h2 id="on-truth">On Truth</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Generalizations are, in general, false.</li>
        <li>Life is too complex to be understood. How can you live without understanding life? If you do not understand, you are not living — you do not have
            complete liberty because your actions are not completely informed. Then, what do you do? You paddle on an ocean that is sometimes peaceful and
            sometimes not. This is life.
        </li>
        <li>The mistake is thinking that contemporary culture is Truth.</li>
        <li>Truth left us because it has its own existential crisis. It realized that it is created by us.</li>
        <li><b>A defect of science. </b>If you want to measure something you have to first measure something else that is artificially adjacent to the thing you
            want to measure in order to find something about the thing you are interested in. For example, you have to measure a ruler before you can measure
            what you want to measure with the ruler. We cannot directly look for 'answers.' How far are we from Truth with our best methods? Maybe this means
            that Truth was never attained and that is, therefore, useless or non-existent (or some ten other adjectives).
        </li>
        <li>Content is the result of forcefully pushing the mind to go from a playful, creative state — where one enjoys oneself — past to a desolate space full
            of half-finished ideas or half-truths or mediocre creativity. All in the search for an exhaustive story. Top 10 of something or other. Music about
            a particular, subjective experience of the artist remodelled, skinned alive so that more people can identify with it. Content is art put in a corner
            and forced to work like a slave. Content is capitalistic art. Content is art without the enjoyment, pain, or emotions art gives to its creators or
            to its admirers. See how this idea got content-ish by the end?
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="on-love">On Love</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In Love there is room for hate but in hate there is no room for Love.</li>
        <li>It could be that self-destruction is the natural reaction of a love-deprived organism. Love might be the blood of Existence.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="on-beauty">On Beauty</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It is not aesthetic to destroy ideas, it is beautiful to create new ones. Ugly people destroy good and evil ideas while beautiful people create new
            ones, extend old ones, or remind people of ancient ones. Why should beautiful people bother with ugly ideas?
        </li>
        <li>Beauty calls to life; ugliness (the unaesthetic) calls to disgust, to death. Disgust is the wish for death.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="on-myself">On Myself</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What am I? The collection of randomly assembled, situational thoughts and ideas that I present, deliver, part with, or say to my interlocutors? The
            I when nobody else is around? If so, which one? The playful one? The serious one? Who am I? The silence which is the result of me quieting my mind?
            The person I am during sleep? The one during the first hour after waking up? The one during the last hour before sleep? The one on my worst day? Or
            on my best day? Am I all of these people? How overwhelming if so. I think I am who I am from second to second; the me now. And since sometimes I
            don't take time to asses just who exactly I am... well... sometimes then I don't know who I am.
        </li>
        <li>Let me tell you something about my mind, if you don't mind. Maybe you'll want to keep reading because you'll identify with it too. Maybe you'll want
            to let me know of our similarity and form a connection from it, maybe start a club or something. Anyways. My mind is like a memory foam mattress.
            Whatever author, artist, or woman do I decide to invite into it, I will memorize part of them and, maybe, I will play something back on the same
            theme, like a hopeful saxophone. People, ideas, stuff can leave an imprint on my mind. But all these imprints go away, or will go away, someday. Or
            will they?
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="on-work">On Work</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't be afraid and anxious to tackle your work. You can make mistakes, that's fine. You will sometimes fail but you will for sure fail if you don't
            do it, that's not fine.
        </li>
        <li>If life is intrinsically meaningless but you can give meaning to it, then there is no meaningless task, project, or job.</li>
        <li>This is — the negative view of — work: to suffer and not be corrupted by the suffering so you can create something out of, because of, or in spite
            of, the suffering.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="on-life">On Life</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Life is suffering. If you are aiming for the absence of suffering, you are not living.</li>
        <li>Who wants to live a life that has an inextricable inherent meaning? That is like somebody telling you what to do.</li>
        <li>Sometimes you have choices to make and sometimes you don't. Make the choices when you do, and enjoy yourself when you don't. Sometimes you have to
            talk to yourself and sometimes you don't. Don't run away from yourself when you do, and run away when you don't.
        </li>
        <li class="no-style-list">
            <ul>
                <li class="text-center no-style-list">
                    What's a bird to a tree?
                    <br/>What's a bird to you and me?
                    <br/>Don't you see?
                    <br/>I don't see.
                    <br/>It's all about you and me.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Fuck this,
                    <br/>and fuck that
                    <br/>Fuck you!
                    <br/>I regret that.
                    <br/>So I'll fuck myself,
                    <br/>and I'll fuck you too.
                    <br/>This poem is confusing.
                    <br/>What the fuck are we gonna do?
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Anyways...
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Fuck this
                    <br/>and fuck that
                    <br/>Not in an unfriendly way,
                    <br/>Is what I'm trying to get at.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Focus on me
                    <br/>and focus on you
                    <br/>Look at the bird
                    <br/>But remember
                    <br/>It's about me and you
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>There's going to be a hundred arguments for and against most things, and most things are about how to live life. Just choose the one <i>you</i>
            want, maybe even if it feels evil, and do it. Arguments are a simulation in void, an artistic game, the whispers of dying scholastics.
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't be afraid of cold. Life's like a walk on a freezing January night. Sure, there's pain. But there's also the adventure of the walk, not knowing
            where your steps take you or sweetly enjoying the route you so thoughtfully planned for yourself as a small gesture of care towards yourself.
            Enjoying the beauty of budding cherry blossoms. Making fun of the smeared shit on the pavement. Giving love to a stranger through a smile. Yes,
            there's cold. But you already got used to it. So let the next bad thing happen with bravery. Because it's about the walk.
        </li>
        <li>
            Deny the denier, the one who wishes for silence and not peace! Life is noise, energy, hurt, pain, nosebleeds, and runy noses. Peace is what you get
            after a full day of life. Don't listen to that voice who logically negates the siren songs of life. Go with it. Get eaten by it. Be ingested by it.
            Then get defecated by it.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="happy-ideas">Happy ideas</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Why continue living? Because biology stops you from killing yourself — the self-preservation instinct. Also, because you will create more suffering
            and tragedy, which you hate, since you probably want to kill yourself because of them. Finally, because probably the reason that pushes you towards
            this action is not that serious, but emotions make it seem bigger, more serious, and more important than it is. Stop taking yourself so seriously.
        </li>
        <li>To be! Because to not be is statistically more prevalent. We can also choose to not be, but it is a privilege to be.</li>
        <li>Our natural impulses are towards life: eat, drink, fuck, self-preserve. Anything we do against life is then unnatural. Therefore, life haters are
            corrupt.
        </li>
        <li>Progress and change the world for the better or be content and enjoy it as it is. Both types of people are necessary.</li>
        <li>Taking a step back means leaving God and embracing the Devil... do not do that. Step forward! Take the Devil by his hand and take him to God.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="toy-ideas">Toy ideas</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Since your current existence lives in your memory and since you will forget this moment ten years from now, you, as you exist now, will die in ten
            years... or... tomorrow.
        </li>
        <li>The sunrise is song, the sunset is poetry.</li>
        <li>Any excess in something shows a lack in something else.</li>
        <li>Don't take minimalism to its extreme: just because there is no need doesn't mean you shouldn't.</li>
        <li>Comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable!</li>
        <li><q>It was his idea!</q> should be a praise, not an accusation — ideas appear rarely.</li>
        <li>Suffering is like gravitation, it has a continuous pull on your life. If you let it, gravity might hurt you. Same with suffering.</li>
        <li><b>Gödel and Existence:</b> we cannot prove Existence because that would mean using an apparatus that is external to Existence; impossible because
            nothing can exist outside Existence.
        </li>
        <li>The small fish is affected even by a small branch thrown into the water, making it run away. The big fish does not move when the small branch is
            thrown into the water.
        </li>
        <li>Nietzsche recommended against hoarding knowledge. But you need decoration to make ideas beautiful.</li>
        <li>A beautiful way to stand out is by being the counter element in the symphony of society. Just like how a song has sharp contrasting elements that
            nevertheless work within the composition, it is nice to have people that oppose, but with rhyme and reason. Maybe with love.
        </li>
