+    <blockquote>
+        <h3>Always use a scale-out and scale-in rule combination that performs an increase and decrease</h3>
+        <p class="is-marginless">If you use only one part of the combination, autoscaling will only take action in a single direction (scale out, or in) until
+            it reaches the maximum, or minimum instance counts of defined in the profile. This is not optimal, ideally you want your resource to scale up at
+            times of high usage to ensure availability. Similarly, at times of low usage you want your resource to scale down, so you can realize cost
+            savings.</p>
+    </blockquote>
+    <p>What this paragraph doesn't say is that if you have a scale condition that looks like:</p>
+    <!-- @formatter:off Until the 'white-space' CSS property improves ... -->
+    <pre>
+<!-- --><code>Scale out</code>
+<!-- --><code>When  example-asp  (Average) CpuPercentage > 90     Increase count by 1</code>
+<!-- --><code>Or    example-asp  (Average) MemoryPercentage > 90  Increase count by 1</code>
+<!-- --><code></code>
+<!-- --><code>Scale in</code>
+<!-- --><code>When  example-asp  (Average) CpuPercentage < 45     Decrease count by 1</code><!--
+ --></pre>
+    <!-- @formatter:on -->
+    <p>Then your <code>example-asp</code> might get a flapping entry in its Activity log.</p>
+    <p>This essay won't provide the reason why this is (because I couldn't figure it out); instead, it will tell the story of how I arrived at this discovery so
+        you can avoid spending one week with a Microsoft representative trying to diagnose the same behavior.</p>
+    <p>I also added this finding to the official documentation.</p>
+    <h2>Work item</h2>
+    <p>On the 17th of June, 2021, I picked up a task from the backlog which read like:</p>
+    <blockquote>
+        <p class="is-marginless">Our App Service Plan is set to scale automatically, but that leads to some errors while the ASP is scaling (it seems mostly
+            HTTP calls that call an instance which is starting or already shutting down?). For prod we set the ASP to 4 S2 instances, without autoscaling. Could
+            you have a look at our ASP to see what we need there; if it's better to disable autoscaling, and how many instances would we need?</p>
+    </blockquote>
+    <p>Please note that the issue in the ticket doesn't really matter; the HTTP errors could have easily been caused because the apps in the ASP didn't have
+        health checks, leading to services hitting unhealthy instances. The only interesting part (of this essay) is the realization that Azure autoscaling is a
+        blackbox service that you can use but not
+        perfectly tune because you don't have all the information, only results and correlations.</p>
+    <p>With that in mind, I looked at the metrics of each individual app and of the ASP. In total, 6 apps had the pattern of a stable instance which gets
+        replaced by another
+        stable instance; each instance lasted for about 4 days. All apps had ephemeral instances (i.e. which had a 1-2 day lifespan). This was because of the
+        sub-optimal scaling condition. The average CPU utilization per app slot was between 23% - 30% while the average memory usage was between
+        63% - 78%. The scale in and scale out rules were based on the <code>CpuPercentage</code> metric, which was fine, but the values of
+        the metric were too close to each other, which lead to flapping (the phenomenon in which instances scale up/down rapidly and repetitively) and to the
+        HTTP error calls.</p>
+    <p>After some tweaking, I arrived at the scale condition mentioned above, which eliminated the HTTP errors but not the flapping. Flapping should have no
+        longer occurred, but, instead, the ASP was stuck with 2 instances.</p>
+    <p>The autoscale engine has a formula for when to scale in:</p>
+    <!-- @formatter:off Until the 'white-space' CSS property improves ... -->
+    <pre>
+<!-- --><code>metric x current instance count / final number of instances when scaled down</code><!--
+ --></pre>
+    <!-- @formatter:on -->
+    <p>The reasoning behind this formula is simple: if you have a workload that is divided across N instances that is to be moved to N-1 instances, then the N-1
+        instances should be able to handle the workload that was present on the N instances.</p>
+    <p>For the ASP in question, the formula then should be: <code>30 (average CPU usage) x 2 (current number of instances) / 1 (desired number of instances) =
+        60</code>. This is 30% below the scale out threshold, yet the ASP was stuck in
+        endless flapping. Only if the outcome of the equation would've been 90% (the scale out threshold) or more should flapping occur.</p>
+    <p>After depleting the available information on the subject (i.e. the official docs, a
+        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49760213/azure-app-service-autoscale-fails-to-scale-in" rel="noopener" target="_blank">StackOverflow
+            post</a>

+            rel="noopener" target="_blank">archived version</a>]) I decided to contact Microsoft.</p>
+    <h2>Microsoft Support ticket</h2>
+    <p>A Microsoft representative from the App Service team proposed two solutions:</p>
+    <ol>
+        <li>Switch the App Service Plan to the P1V2 tier: same costs but newer hardware with slightly more computing resources.</li>
+        <li>Remove the <code>MemoryPercentage</code> rule as it might interfere with the CPU one. Alternatively, add a scale down <code>MemoryPercentage</code>
+            rule, which I didn't do because memory usage was more fluctuating.
+        </li>
+    </ol>
+    <p>He also recommended lowering the scale out threshold to 80 because that's what they usually recommend to their clients.</p>
+    <p>The first solution didn't eliminate the flapping but the second one did. The representative didn't explain why or how a scale out rule might interfere
+        with another scale out rule, even after I pointed out that the <code>Or</code> in the scale condition syntax makes it seem like the scale out rules are
+        not connected to each other.</p>
+    <p>I chose to ignore his recommendation based on 2 facts:</p>
+    <ol>
+        <li>The way the CPU usage increases in the ASP (i.e. rare spikes that go from 30% straight to 90% - 95% in under 1 minute) makes it so that reducing the
+            scale out threshold by 10% would have no positive impact and one negative impact; that is
+        </li>
+        <li>Lowering the scale out threshold would require me lowering the scale in threshold too (for example, to 30%). This would result in an inefficient use
+            of computing resources because the average CPU utilization is 30%, meaning that the instance count would never scale in to 1. I would have to lower
+            the scale in threshold because of the way Azure determines when to scale in. If the CPU usage is 44% (slightly below the current scale in threshold)
+            averaged across 2 instances, Azure would perform the following calculation: <code>44 x 2 / 1 = 88</code>. The result is above the recommended scale
+            out threshold of 80. Thus, Azure will produce a flapping event and refrain from scaling in because the ASP would have to scale out again immediately
+            afterwards.

+    <p>But the issue was closed. The only reason I'm explaining myself is to give context for the questions I am still left with.</p>
+    <h2>Questions</h2>
+    <ul>
+        <li>How does the autoscale engine (a.k.a. the Azure Monitor autoscale feature/service) evaluate the scaling condition? I would love to see the
+            algorithm.
+        </li>
+        <li>How often does the autoscale engine evaluate the scaling condition?</li>
+        <li>How does the autoscale engine resolve edge-cases? For example, is it safe for me to keep scale in and out rules that leave no margin of error for
+            the scale in calculation (as described in the second fact above)? The
