    <p>Did you know that DuPont, a chemical company, knowingly poisoned the water of West Virginia with a Teflon-processing aid called PFOA? Two types of cancer, 5 other illnesses. Facial deformities, birth defects.</p>
    <p>What were they doing?</p>
    <p>And they’re in the S&amp;P 500. So we own part of it.</p>
    <p>Their stock price over the last 10 years? Increased. Even during their trial. Hell, 3 years after the first public case their stock price hit an all-time high.</p>
    <p>3535 cases, settled for $670m. 2023 revenue of $12B.</p>
    <p>Aaaand PFOA is now believed to be in the blood of 99% of humans.</p>
    <p>What are we doing?</p>
    <p>I recall recently hearing that, nowadays, the deals with the devil aren’t what they used to be. Isn’t that what I’m doing by continuing to invest in the market? And if I don’t? I’m poorer. Inflation was at 10% in the UK. Best savings account? 7%. If you’re not playing the game, you lose.</p>
    <p>It gets worse. Let’s not forget my pension account.</p>
    <p>That’s insane.</p>
    <p>What am I doing?</p>
    <p>If you look, you will probably find this everywhere. We participate in it by supporting them in some way, sometimes without knowing. You can’t really avoid it unless you go become a hermit or something.</p>
    <p>And it's not like the opposite is good. Being a hermit doesn't help humanity. So, you gotta swim the dark waters, but towards a bright shore.</p>
    <p>Is that what you are doing?</p>
