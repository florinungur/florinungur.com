        <p class="dropcap">
          Welcome! Welcome to my humble digital abode, to my corner of the internet, to another website with a
          forgettable name that you will bookmark but will seldomly return to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have several essays lined up and ready to go, but this one seems the most difficult. Maybe because it is the
          first one, maybe because this essay is meant to explicate the implicit assumptions of my website... maybe
          both. So, to achieve the goal of this essay, I will talk about:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>what I write about,</li>
          <li>how the website is built, and</li>
          <li>why the website is built.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Why am I writing about this? It feels like a cliché by now, but, as
          <a href="https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"
            >Alex Nixon said</a
          >
          [<a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200722020956/https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html"
            rel="noopener"
            target="_blank"
            >archived link</a
          >], it is to justify to myself why I made this website and how.
        </p>

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
          I will write about philosophy, psychology, and technology. Take a look around my website; look at
          <a href="../../../../ideas" target="_blank">my ideas</a>, for example, and you will get a taste of what is to
          come, content-wise, from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will write about issues I searched for but could not find a satisfactory answer to. I will also write about
          myself — my ideas, philosophy, stuff like that. I will try, as much as possible, to only write stuff that
          never existed before.
        </p>

        <h2>Styling</h2>
        <p>Because the medium is the message, I also have to talk about this website.</p>
        <p>
          The styling was VERY HARD. There are so many different CSS frameworks to choose from and so many website
          designs that I like (more on this below)... I settled on making my own CSS which I based on
          <a href="https://jenil.github.io/chota/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">chota</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is for reading, so I did not add a lot of padding — no wasted space in my layout! No animated
          content. No fixed floating header.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created the favicon using
          <a href="https://www.photopea.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Photopea</a>
          and converted it to multiple formats using
          <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net" rel="noopener" target="_blank">realfavicongenerator.net</a>. (You
          can grab the <a href="../../../../img/favicon/favicon.psd" target="_blank">.PSD file</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The logo (my name + the favicon) was created by my friend
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alexandra_argh/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alex Arghiriade</a>,
          because I am definitely not a web designer. I did a previous iteration myself, but it did not click as much as
          the current logo does. The font is Segoe UI SemiLight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found the artwork at the top of this essay on
          <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23919590" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> [<a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200901035747/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23919590"
            rel="noopener"
            target="_blank"
            >archived link</a
          >]. There are more AI artists out there:
          <a href="https://art42.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">art42.net</a>
          and
          <a href="https://thisartworkdoesnotexist.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thisartworkdoesnotexist.com</a>,
          for example.
        </p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I finally decided to make this website because I no longer feel that my ideas, poems, and essays are trash.
          Secondly, publishing these things pushes me to get rid of the trash. Lastly, I want an email address with a
          custom domain. That is it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might have noticed that I like to archive every link. This is because I like the idea of a sustainable,
          long-lasting, free, and fun internet. This preference, I think, is shared by people like the guys at

          accessibility standards and why I will probably translate the content into several languages later.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last "land" of my digital philosophy is all about simplicity, balance, and durability. I am writing all
          the pages in plain HTML with CSS I (kind of) understand. This partly takes care of simplicity and durability.
          Balance? I do not use any JavaScript; not because I dislike it (my third year internship was all about it),
          but because I do not need it for this project. Balance, for me, is about only juggling the stuff you like,
          want, need, plus some extra fluff. Throwing something on just because also throws you — or a website — off
          balance. You can restore the balance by putting in extra effort (i.e. using JavaScript to better achieve this
          website's goals and philosophy) or by probably five or six more ways, what do I know? I am wary about putting
          in extra effort for fluff. I spare this energy for other "unbalanced" things, like my obsession with words.
          Case in point: using
          <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highlight.js</a> would not, on one side,
          throw the website off balance because I would use this code to improve the reading experience, make it more
          fun. On the other side, though, it would come in conflict with my love for simplicity and, arguably, with my
          desire for durability. But life is a balancing act. Who knows... in the future the reading experience might
          take more weight than simplicity and durability, so then the balance would need to be restored.
        </p>
