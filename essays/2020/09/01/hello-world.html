            This website will have mostly philosophy-, psychology-, and technology-related content. I aim to display
            this content on a simple yet beautiful website that is designed to last and to be accessible to as many
            types of people as possible throughout its lifetime.

        <p class="dropcap">
          Welcome! Welcome to my humble digital abode, to my corner of the internet, to another website with a
          forgettable name that you will bookmark but will seldomly return to.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have several essays lined up and ready to go, but this one seems the most difficult. Maybe because it is the
          first one, maybe because this essay is meant to explicate the implicit assumptions of my website... maybe
          both. So, to achieve the goal of this essay, I will talk about:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>what I write about,</li>
          <li>how the website is built, and</li>
          <li>why the website is built.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Why am I writing about this? It feels like a cliché by now, but, as
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200722020956/https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            >Alex Nixon said</a
          >, it is to justify to myself why I made this website and how.
        </p>

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
          I will write about philosophy, psychology, and technology. Take a look around my website; look at
          <a href="../../../../ideas" target="_blank">my ideas</a>, for example, and you will get a taste of what is to
          come, content-wise, from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will write about issues I searched for but could not find a satisfactory answer to. I will also write about
          myself — my ideas, philosophy, stuff like that. I will try, as much as possible, to only write stuff that
          never existed before.
        </p>

        <h2>Styling</h2>
        <p>Because the medium is the message, I also have to talk about this website.</p>
        <p>
          The styling was VERY HARD. I love art but I suffer from choice anxiety. There are so many different CSS
          frameworks to choose from and so many website styles that I like (more on this below). I settled on
          <a href="https://jenil.github.io/chota/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chota</a>
          for now because of its lightness, because it provided easy instructions to write my only JavaScript file (<a
            href="../../../../js/dark-mode.js"
            target="_blank"
            >dark-mode.js</a
          >), and because it has cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is for reading, so I did not add a lot of padding — no wasted space in my layout! No animated
          content. No fixed floating header.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created the favicon using
          <a href="https://www.photopea.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Photopea</a>
          and converted it to multiple formats using
          <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
            >realfavicongenerator.net</a
          >. (You can grab the <a href="../../../../img/favicon/favicon.psd" target="_blank">.PSD file</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The logo (my name + the favicon) was created by my friend
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alexandra_argh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
            >Alex Arghiriade</a
          >, because I am definetely not a web designer. I did a previous iteration myself but it did not click as much
          as the current logo does. The font is Segoe UI SemiLight.
        </p>

        <p>
          I found the artwork at the top of this essay on
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200901035747/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23919590"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            >Hacker News</a
          >. There are more AI artists out there:
          <a href="https://art42.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">art42.net</a>
          and
          <a href="https://thisartworkdoesnotexist.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
            >thisartworkdoesnotexist.com</a
          >, for example.
        </p>

        <h2>Inspirations</h2>
        <p>I was inspired by these websites:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200901035834/https://brandur.org/"

              rel="noopener noreferrer"

              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
              >tonsky.me</a
            >

          <li>
            <a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200901035957/https://fingers.today/"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
              >fingers.today</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200901040029/https://jmduke.com/"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
              >jmduke.com</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I was also probably inspired by my <a href="../../../../webmarks" target="_blank">webmarks</a>.</p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          You might have noticed that I like to archive every link. This is because I believe in a sustainable,
          long-lasting, free, and fun internet, beliefs which, I think, are shared by people like
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200724092502/https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/"

            target="_blank"
            >the guys at LOW←TECH MAGAZINE</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200621074025/https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            >Parimal Satyal</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200708045446/https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            >Jeff Huang</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200724093257/https://tinyprojects.dev/posts/tiny_websites_are_great"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            >and Ben</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also believe in an accessible internet, hence why I strived to make the website conform to some
          accessibility standards (like, for example,
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200901061821/https://sourcehut.org/blog/2020-05-27-accessibility-through-simplicity/"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            >SourceHut</a
          >), and why I will probably translate the content into several languages later.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like simplicity, balance, and durability, hence why I am writing all the pages in plain HTML with CSS I
          (kind of) understand and with minimal tooling overhead.
        </p>
        <p>The tools in question are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the VSCode IDE with the Prettier, ESLint, and Live Server extensions for writing the content;</li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/ungurflorin/florinungur.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
              >GitHub</a
            >
            and <a href="https://soverin.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Soverin</a> for hosting said
            content;
          </li>
          <li>
            Microsoft's
            <a href="https://accessibilityinsights.io/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
              >Accessibility Insights</a
            >
            and IBM's
            <a href="https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Equal Access</a>
            for accessibility testing;
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.checkbot.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Checkbot</a>
            for assessing the SEO, speed, and security of my website; and, finally
          </li>
          <li>
            Mozilla's
            <a href="https://observatory.mozilla.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Observatory</a>
            and Google Chrome's
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
              >Lighthouse</a
            >
            for a holistic assessment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          (I found some of these tools on Shawn Wang's
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831180535/https://www.swyx.io/writing/webperf-tests/"

            target="_blank"
            >website</a
          >
          which, in turn, I stumbled upon in the comments of an
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831180606/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23119701"

            target="_blank"
            >HN article</a
          >. And I say that this is a minimal tooling overhead because I will use all tools only at the beggining, to
          improve my website and learn new stuff. The only long-term tools will be the first two bullet points, but even
          with those included I will not be affected if any/all of these tools will disappear or, worse, be
          discontinued. I will just change to an alternative.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Not to be clickbaity and get to the subtitle of this essay last, but... I finally decided to make this website
          because I no longer feel that my ideas, poems, and essays are trash. Secondly, publishing these things pushes
          me to get rid of the trash. Lastly, I want an email address with a custom domain. That is it.
