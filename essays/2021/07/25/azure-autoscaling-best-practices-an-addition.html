        [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210506173759/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-best-practices"
            rel="noopener" target="_blank">archived Microsoft Docs link</a>] is:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <h3>Always use a scale-out and scale-in rule combination that performs an increase and decrease</h3>
        <p class="is-marginless">If you use only one part of the combination, autoscaling will only take action in a single direction (scale out, or in) until
            it reaches the maximum, or minimum instance counts, as defined in the profile. This is not optimal, ideally you want your resource to scale up at
            times of high usage to ensure availability. Similarly, at times of low usage you want your resource to scale down, so you can realize cost
            savings.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What this paragraph doesn't say is that if you have a scale condition like:</p>
    <!-- @formatter:off Until the 'white-space' CSS property improves ... -->
    <pre>
<!-- --><code>Scale out</code>
<!-- --><code>When  example-asp  (Average) CpuPercentage > 90     Increase count by 1</code>
<!-- --><code>Or    example-asp  (Average) MemoryPercentage > 90  Increase count by 1</code>
<!-- --><code></code>
<!-- --><code>Scale in</code>
<!-- --><code>When  example-asp  (Average) CpuPercentage < 45     Decrease count by 1</code><!--
 --></pre>
    <!-- @formatter:on -->
    <p>Then your <code>example-asp</code> might get stuck in a flapping state (the condition in which instances scale up and down rapidly and repetitively).</p>
    <p>This essay won't provide the reason why this is (because I couldn't figure it out); instead, it will tell the story of how I arrived at this discovery so
        you can avoid spending one week with a Microsoft representative trying to diagnose the same behavior.</p>
    <h2>Work item</h2>
    <p>On the 17th of June, 2021, I picked up a task from the backlog which read:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p class="is-marginless">Our App Service Plan is set to scale automatically, but that leads to some errors while the ASP is scaling: (it seems) mostly
            HTTP calls that call an instance which is starting or shutting down. For prod we set the ASP to 4 S2 instances, without autoscaling. Please
            investigate if it's better to disable autoscaling and, if so, how many instances would we need?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Please note that this task only provides context, it is not essential for understanding the topic at hand. The HTTP errors could have easily been caused
        by services hitting unhealthy instances because the apps in the ASP didn't have health checks. But, investigating the problem from the ticket lead me to
        the core issue of this essay: Azure autoscaling is a black box service that you can use but not perfectly tune because you don't have all the
        information, only metrics, logs, and correlations.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, I looked at the metrics of each individual app and of the ASP. In total, 6 apps had the pattern of a stable instance which got
        replaced by another stable instance; each instance lasted for about 4 days. All apps had ephemeral instances (i.e. with a 1-2 day lifespan). This was
        because of the sub-optimal scaling condition.</p>
    <p>The average CPU utilization of the ASP was between 23% - 30% while the average memory usage was between 63% - 78%.</p>

    <p>The scale in and scale out rules were based on the <code>CpuPercentage</code> metric, which was fine, but the scale in and scale out thresholds were too
        close to each other, which lead to flapping and, possibly, to the HTTP error calls. After some tweaking, I arrived at the scale condition mentioned
        above, which eliminated the HTTP errors but not the flapping. Flapping should have no longer occurred, but, instead, the ASP was stuck with 2 instances.
    </p>
    <p>The autoscale engine determines when to scale in based on the following formula:</p>
    <!-- @formatter:off Until the 'white-space' CSS property improves ... -->
    <pre>
<!-- --><code>metric x current instance count / final number of instances when scaled down</code><!--
 --></pre>
    <!-- @formatter:on -->
    <p>The reasoning behind this equation is simple: if you have a workload that is divided across N instances that is to be moved to N-1 instances, then the
        N-1 instances should be able to handle the workload that was present on the N instances.</p>
    <p>For the ASP in question, the formula then should be: <code>30 (average CPU usage) x 2 (current number of instances) / 1 (desired number of instances) =
        60</code>. This is 30% below the scale out threshold, yet the ASP was stuck in endless flapping. Only if the outcome of the equation would've been 90%
        (the scale out threshold) or more should flapping occur.</p>
    <p>After depleting the available information on the subject (i.e. the official docs, a
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49760213/azure-app-service-autoscale-fails-to-scale-in" rel="noopener" target="_blank">StackOverflow
            post</a>

        [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210302053114/https://camerondwyer.com/2019/04/02/azure-app-service-my-experience-with-auto-scale-in-failing/"
            rel="noopener" target="_blank">archived version</a>]) I decided to contact Microsoft.</p>
    <h2>Microsoft Support ticket</h2>
    <p>A Microsoft representative from the App Service team proposed two solutions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Switch the App Service Plan to the P1V2 tier: same costs but newer hardware with slightly more computing resources.</li>
        <li>Remove the <code>MemoryPercentage</code> rule as it might interfere with the CPU one. Alternatively, add a scale down <code>MemoryPercentage</code>
            rule, which I didn't do because memory usage was more fluctuating.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>He also recommended lowering the scale out threshold to 80 because that's what they usually recommend to their clients.</p>
    <p>The first solution didn't eliminate the flapping but the second one did. The representative didn't explain why or how a scale out rule might interfere
        with another scale out rule, even after I pointed out that the <code>Or</code> in the scale condition syntax makes it seem like the scale out rules are
        not connected to each other.</p>
    <p>I chose to ignore his recommendation based on 2 facts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The way the CPU usage increases in the ASP (i.e. rare spikes that go from 30% straight to 90% - 95% in under 1 minute) makes it so that reducing the
            scale out threshold by 10% would have no positive impact and one negative impact; that is...
        </li>
        <li>Lowering the scale out threshold would require me lowering the scale in threshold too (for example, to 40%). This would result in an inefficient use
            of computing resources because the average CPU utilization is 30% (with the occasional idling at 40%-50%%), meaning that the autoscale engine would
            perform more autoscale events than necessary, which might cause the original problem (HTTP errors) to reoccur. I would have to lower the scale in
            threshold because of the way the engine determines when to scale in. If the CPU usage is 44% (slightly below the current scale in threshold)
            averaged across 2 instances, the Azure autoscaler would perform the following calculation: <code>44 x 2 / 1 = 88</code>. The result is above the
            recommended scale out threshold of 80. Thus, the autoscaler would produce a flapping event and refrain from scaling in because the ASP would have to
            scale out again immediately afterwards.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>But the issue was closed:</p>

    <p>The only reason I'm explaining myself is to give context for the questions I am still left with.</p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How does the autoscale engine (a.k.a. the Azure Monitor autoscale feature/service) evaluate the scaling condition? I would love to see the
            algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>How often does the autoscale engine evaluate the scaling condition?</li>
        <li>How does the autoscale engine resolve edge-cases? For example, is it safe for me to keep scale in and out rules that leave no margin of error for
            the scale in calculation (as described in the second fact above)? The
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-best-practices#ensure-the-maximum-and-minimum-values-are-different-and-have-an-adequate-margin-between-them"

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short: <i>how does Azure autoscaling work, precisely?</i>
