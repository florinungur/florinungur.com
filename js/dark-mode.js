 *  2. If the theme preference at the OS level is light, the only other condition
 *     needed for the page to be dark is for the theme in local storage to be dark.
 *     If 'null' would also be accepted, that would mean that a new user which prefers
 *     the light theme at the OS level would always get the dark theme of the website,
 *     unless they manually select otherwise using the ‚òÄÔ∏è/üåô button.
