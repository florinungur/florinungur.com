            They might be exhausted but they persevere. They may be fearful but they face danger courageously. They may

            undeterred by profoundly intractable problems and/or by dangerously potent antagonists. In the face of
            either or both, they are undaunted.

          <p>
            It is divine service to serve oneself. We thus relieve humanity of ourselves. May one man carry another's
            burden, has become an immorality. May each carry his own load; that is the least that one can demand anyone
            to do. We can at best show another how to carry his own load. To give all one's goods to the poor means to
            educate them to become idle. Pity should not carry another's load, but it should be a strict educator
            instead. Solitude with ourselves has no end. It has only just begun.

          <p>
            There is only one way and that is your way. There is only one salvation and that is your salvation. Why are
            you looking for help? Do you believe help will come from outside? What is to come will be created in you and
            from you. Hence look into yourself. Do not compare. Do not measure. No other way is like yours. All other
            ways deceive and tempt you. You must fulfill the way that is in you.

            Woe betide those who live by way of examples! Life is not with them. If you live according to an example,
            you thus live the life of that example, but who should live your own life if not yourself? So live
            yourselves. This is not a law, but notice of the fact that the time of example and law, and of the straight
            line drawn in advance has become overripe. [...] Yet who today knows this? Who knows the way to the
            eternally fruitful climes of the soul? You seek the way through mere appearances, you study books and give
            ear to all kinds of opinion. What good is all that?

            Madness is a special form of the spirit and clings to all teachings and philosophies, but even more to daily
            life, since life itself is full of craziness and at bottom utterly illogical. Man strives toward reason only
            so that he can make rules for himself. Life itself has no rules. That is its mystery and its unknown law.

            tree of my life grows from it and conjoins the Below with the Above. At both ends there is fire and blazing
            embers. The Above is fiery and the Below is fiery. Between the unbearable fires grows your life. You hang

            He who accepts what approaches him because it is also in him, quarrels and wrangles no more, but looks into
            himself and keeps silent. He sees the tree of life, whose roots reach into Hell and whose top touches
            Heaven. He also no longer knows differences: who is right? What is holy? What is genuine? What is good? What
            is correct? He knows only one difference: the difference between below and above. For he sees that the tree
            of life grows from below to above, and that it has its crown at the top, clearly differentiated from the
            roots. To him this is unquestionable. Hence he knows the way to salvation. To unlearn all distinctions save
            that concerning direction is part of your salvation. Hence you free yourself from the old curse of the
            knowledge of good and evil.

            You can never deny your knowledge of good and evil to yourself, so that you could betray your good in order
            to live evil. For as soon as you separate good and evil, you recognize them. They are united only in growth.
            But you grow if you stand still in the greatest doubt, and therefore steadfastness in great doubt is a
            veritable flower of life.

            yourself. Joy should neither be made nor sought; it should come, if it must come. [...] You should not serve
            your personal devil. That leads to superfluous pain. True joy is simple: it comes and exists from itself,
            and is not to be sought here and there. [...] Joy can never ever be prepared, but exists of its own accord
            or exists not at all. All you must do is fulfill your task, nothing else. Joy comes from fulfillment, but
            not from longing.

            It is remarkable that the intellect manages to do this, for in reality this faculty is given only as a help
            to the most unfortunate, most delicate, and most perishable creature, in order to preserve it for a moment
            in an existence out of which it would otherwise [...] have every reason to flee.

            Whence and when came to him the mystic bent into the One and the eternally Resting, nobody will be able to
            compute; perhaps it is only the conception of the finally settled old man, to whom, after the agitation of
            his erratic wanderings, and after the restless learning and searching for truth, the vision of a divine
            rest, the permanence of all things within a pantheistic primal peace appears as the highest and greatest
            ideal.

            A needy person wants their friends to think they're cool or funny or smart and will constantly try to
            impress them with their coolness or humor or smart opinions about everything. A non-needy person just enjoys
            spending time with their friends for the sake of spending time with them and doesn't feel the need to
            perform around them.

            And so, if you take nothing else away from this, just know that the way to find true love is to be the best
            version of yourself and do it unapologetically and without shame. You'll attract people into your life who
            connect with you on your level and, just as importantly, you'll weed out all the people who don't.

            Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that
            mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother. You don't need to be constantly reminding yourself
            why you shouldn't wait. Just don't wait.

            Listen, we are just human beings. Right? We're human beings first, before we're Hindu, or Buddhist, or

            top of something far deeper. That should be obvious.

            Once upon a time there was a crooked tree and a straight tree. And they grew next to each other. And every
            day the straight tree would look at the crooked tree and he would say:
            <q
              >you're crooked, you've always been crooked, and you'll continue to be crooked. But look at me, look at
              me, said the straight tree, he said I'm tall and I'm straight.</q
            >
            And then one day the lumberjacks came into the forest, and looked around, and the manager in charge said:
            cut all the straight trees. And that crooked tree is still there to this day, growing strong and growing
            strange.
