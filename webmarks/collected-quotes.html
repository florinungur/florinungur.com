            <p>It is divine service to serve oneself. We thus relieve humanity of ourselves. May one man carry another's burden, has become an immorality. May
                each carry his own load; that is the least that one can demand anyone to do. We can at best show another how to carry his own load. To give all
                one's goods to the poor means to educate them to become idle. Pity should not carry another's load, but it should be a strict educator instead.
                Solitude with ourselves has no end. It has only just begun.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>There is only one way and that is your way. There is only one salvation and that is your salvation. Why are you looking for help? Do you believe
                help will come from outside? What is to come will be created in you and from you. Hence look into yourself. Do not compare. Do not measure. No
                other way is like yours. All other ways deceive and tempt you. You must fulfill the way that is in you.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Woe betide those who live by way of examples! Life is not with them. If you live according to an example, you thus live the life of that example,
                but who should live your own life if not yourself? So live yourselves. This is not a law, but notice of the fact that the time of example and
                law, and of the straight line drawn in advance has become overripe. [...] Yet who today knows this? Who knows the way to the eternally fruitful
                climes of the soul? You seek the way through mere appearances, you study books and give ear to all kinds of opinion. What good is all that?</p>

            <p>Nature is playful and terrible. Some see the playful side and dally with it and let it sparkle. Others see the horror and cover their heads and
                are more dead than alive. The way does not lead between both, but embraces both. It is both cheerful play and cold horror.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>When thinking leads to the unthinkable, it is time to return to simple life. What thinking cannot solve, life solves, and what action never

        <blockquote>
            <p>Madness is a special form of the spirit and clings to all teachings and philosophies, but even more to daily life, since life itself is full of
                craziness and at bottom utterly illogical. Man strives toward reason only so that he can make rules for himself. Life itself has no rules. That
                is its mystery and its unknown law. What you call knowledge is an attempt to impose something comprehensible on life.</p>
            <cite>— The Red Book</cite>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The way, or whatever it might be, on which people go, is our way, the right way. There are no paved ways into the future. We say that it is this
                way, and it is. We build roads by going on. Our life is the truth that we seek. Only my life is the truth, the truth above all. We create the
                truth by living it.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>If I accept the lowest in me, I lower a seed into the ground of Hell. The seed is invisibly small, but the tree of my life grows from it and
                conjoins the Below with the Above. At both ends there is fire and blazing embers. The Above is fiery and the Below is fiery. Between the
                unbearable fires grows your life. You hang between these two poles. [...] Therefore he who strives for the highest finds the deepest.</p>
            <cite>— The Red Book</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>He who accepts what approaches him because it is also in him, quarrels and wrangles no more, but looks into himself and keeps silent. He sees the
                tree of life, whose roots reach into Hell and whose top touches Heaven. He also no longer knows differences: who is right? What is holy? What is
                genuine? What is good? What is correct? He knows only one difference: the difference between below and above. For he sees that the tree of life
                grows from below to above, and that it has its crown at the top, clearly differentiated from the roots. To him this is unquestionable. Hence he
                knows the way to salvation. To unlearn all distinctions save that concerning direction is part of your salvation. Hence you free yourself from
                the old curse of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
            <cite>— The Red Book</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>You can never deny your knowledge of good and evil to yourself, so that you could betray your good in order to live evil. For as soon as you
                separate good and evil, you recognize them. They are united only in growth. But you grow if you stand still in the greatest doubt, and therefore
                steadfastness in great doubt is a veritable flower of life.</p>
            <cite>— The Red Book</cite>

            <p>You turn your pain into pleasure. You are twisted, blinded; just suffer, you fool.</p>
            <cite>— The Red Book</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The God knows only power and creation. He commands and you act. Your anxieties are laughable. There is only one road, the military road of the
                Godhead. [...] The sacrifice of all joy, provided that you do it yourself. Joy should neither be made nor sought; it should come, if it must
                come. [...] You should not serve your personal devil. That leads to superfluous pain. True joy is simple: it comes and exists from itself, and
                is not to be sought here and there. [...] Joy can never ever be prepared, but exists of its own accord or exists not at all. All you must do is
                fulfill your task, nothing else. Joy comes from fulfillment, but not from longing.</p>
            <cite>— The Red Book</cite>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Fear the soul, despise her, love her, just like the Gods. May they be far from us! But above all never lose them! Because when lost they are as
                malicious as the serpent, as bloodthirsty as the tiger that pounces on the unsuspecting from behind. A man who goes astray becomes an animal, a
                lost soul becomes a devil.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p class="is-marginless">Once upon a time there was a crooked tree and a straight tree. And they grew next to each other. And every day the straight tree would look at
                the crooked tree and he would say: <q>you're crooked, you've always been crooked, and you'll continue to be crooked. But look at me, look at me,
                    said the straight tree, he said I'm tall and I'm straight.</q> And then one day the lumberjacks came into the forest, and looked around, and
                the manager in charge said: cut all the straight trees. And that crooked tree is still there to this day, growing strong and growing strange.
