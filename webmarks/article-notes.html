        <li>He was a bad driver.</li>

        <li>John was first homeschooled, then enrolled in schools with like-minded people.</li>
        <li><q>He eventually graduated both as a chemical engineer from ETH and with Ph.D. in mathematics, <i>summa cum laude</i> from the University of

        <li>Distinguish your wants from your needs and moderate the former.</li>
        <li>Simplify your life, try to do with less: less stuff, less theorizing, less talking, and proper, lean thinking.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Why? Because, I think, you don't really need your wants to live a good life, and too many wants can paradoxically lead to a bad life.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Nietzsche admired Diogeneses because he tried to show to people the worthlessness of the values they lived by in order to replace them by better
            ones. Nietzsche appropriated this Cynical theme in his own Transvaluation of All Values.
        </li>
        <li>As opposed to Nietzsche, however, cynics see wealth and power as without intrinsic value and as positive evils in that they take from you your own
            inner freedom.

        <li><q>Many people are so worried about looking good that they never do anything great. Many people are so worried about doing something great that they
            never do anything at all.</q></li>
        <li>There are multiple note-worthy HN comments, like this one from @dcolkitt:
            <blockquote>
                <p>> Ninety-three percent of drivers say they are safer-than-average drivers.</p>
                <p>Daniel Kahneman, who won a Nobel prize for studying these types of cognitive biases, has a really good explanation for this. The human mind
                    has a strong tendency to invisibly substitute hard questions for easy ones. When faced with a difficult question like "what are this
                    company's future prospects?", we tend to subconsciously answer an easier question like <q>do the founders of this company appear competent
                        and confident?</q>
                <p>
                <p>This, not arrogance, is the main reason why so many rate themselves as above average at common tasks. Truly ranking yourself is pretty
                    cognitively difficult. You have to construct a mental model of the full range of driving ability in the population, then place yourself in
                    it. So almost everybody substitutes the much easier question <q>am I good driver?</q> instead of <q>am I an above average driver?</q>. And
                    the reality is most driver, even those slightly below average are basically good drivers.</p>
                <p>In other skills though, where most people perceive themselves as not good, the effect is flipped. For example well over 50% of people will
                    rate themselves as below average when you ask them about their ability to strike up a conversation with strangers.</p>

        <li>Luck = Doing (something you like) * Telling (lots of people about it)</li>
        <li>The HN comments are good too. Example from @KineticLensman:
            <blockquote>
                <p>I'll stick with the proverbial Seneca: <q>Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.</q></p>
                <p>Which is actually a generalization of the author's (relatively narrow) thesis where 'opportunity' depends primarily on the people that you
                    meet and the 'preparation' is being passionate about something.</p>

        <li>Brandur suggests that all systems have the tendency to grow in complexity. If we understand this tendency and the systems themselves, we can reverse
            this tendency, making systems evermore simple: <q>I project this onto technology to mean building a stack that scales to more users and more
                activity while the people and infrastructure supporting it stay fixed.</q>

        <li>The filesystem hierarchy described in the FHS is independent from the filesystem type (e.g. ext4, btrfs).</li>
        <li>In Windows, <code>C:</code> and <code>D:</code> drives have separate root directories and directory trees, as opposed to Linux and other UNIX
            systems which have all drives share the same root.
        </li>
        <li>You can mount different filesystem types under the same root filesystem.</li>
        <li><q>To mount</q> a filesystem refers back to when a tape would need to be physically mounted on a drive device. A mount point is just a directory
            under <code>/</code>.
        </li>
        <li><code>/etc/fstab</code> = file system table</li>
