        <li>Nietzsche admired Diogeneses because he tried to show to people the worthlessness of the values they lived by in order to replace them by better
            ones. Nietzsche appropriated this Cynical theme in his own Transvaluation of All Values.
        </li>
        <li>As opposed to Nietzsche, however, cynics see wealth and power as without intrinsic value and as positive evils in that they take from you your own

            never do anything at all.</q></li>
        <li>There are multiple note-worthy HN comments, like this one from dcolkitt:<br/> <q>Daniel Kahneman, who won a Nobel prize for studying these types of
            cognitive biases, has a really good explanation for this. The human mind has a strong tendency to invisibly substitute hard questions for easy ones.
            When faced with a difficult question like "what are this company's future prospects?", we tend to subconsciously answer an easier question like "do
            the founders of this company appear competent and confident?"<br/><br/> This, not arrogance, is the main reason why so many rate themselves as above
            average at common tasks. Truly ranking yourself is pretty cognitively difficult. You have to construct a mental model of the full range of driving
            ability in the population, then place yourself in it. So almost everybody substitutes the much easier question "am I good driver?" instead of "am I
            an above average driver?". And the reality is most driver, even those slightly below average are basically good drivers.<br/><br/> In other skills
            though, where most people perceive themselves as not good, the effect is flipped. For example well over 50% of people will rate themselves as below
            average when you ask them about their ability to strike up a conversation with strangers.</q>
