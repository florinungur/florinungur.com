        <li>
          For Jung, all religious ideas ale equally valid as expressions of human psychic life. Also, all religious
          "truths" and objects are simply psychological.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Maybe this is connected with Nietzsche's claim that all philosophers do is articulate their being through
            their writing, not discovering absolute truths.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          For Jung, the knowledge of God is self-knowledge. Kinda like for Jesus:

            Why? Because, I think, you don't really need your wants to live a good life, and too many wants can

          Nietzsche admired Diogeneses because he tried to show to people the worthlessness of the values they lived by
          in order to replace them by better ones. Nietzsche appropriated this Cynical theme in his own Transvaluation
          of All Values.
        </li>
        <li>
          As opposed to Nietzsche, however, cynics see wealth and power as without intrinsic value and as positive evils
          in that they take from you your own inner freedom.

          <b>The living being vs. the rational being</b>: The living being does things to continue living as its top
          priority, the rational being does not keep the same top priority. Nietzsche belived that people are not
          rational (philosophers included).
        </li>
        <li>
          Nietzsche thought that every philosopher is articulating their being through their writing, not discovering

          Evil are those values who harm oneself or others and tend towards decadence and death (e.g. the envious values
          destruction for its own sake).

        <li>Values can be corrupted by time.</li>

            >The hero is the individual whose commitment to values far exceeds that of normality and whose value system

            Heroism means giving your ethics some thought and not fooling yourself (i.e. not acting against your
            ethics).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Heroism is not self-sacrifice: a hero advances both human well-being and his own goals. Maybe he advances
          humankind through acting on his goals and values.

            This reflects Jordan Peterson's view that if you get better, so will society at large, in a small or big
            way.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          The foremost attribute of a hero is their dauntless commitment to their values. They face challenges instead
          of cowering from them.

        <li>There are degress of heroism. If you're not as big as Jung, you can be a demi-hero.</li>

          Intimacy nails you down to the ground, it makes you sane. It detracts from the perfection one can attain while
          being alone, but it offers you something more.

          Don't rush to innovative technologies. If your security team isn't good, wait for new tech to be vetted by
          trusted sources. Ensure that the technologies will replace something old or that will add new necessary
          functionality. If it only makes life more comfortable, be more skeptical.

          Brandur suggests that all systems have the tendency to grow in complexity. If we understand this tendency and
          the systems themselves, we can reverse this tendency, making systems evermore simple:
