    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Almost all of Nietzsche's books (save for the ones about Wagner)</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Nietzsche believed in upgrading man to a new species through a <b>transvaluation of all values</b>, which included getting rid of Christianity
                (although he saw its necessity, even now) and acknowledging that men have a <b>Will to Power</b> (i.e. domination or mastery over others,
                oneself, or the environment).
            </li>
            <li>He thought that Christianity comes from a <b>slave morality</b> and promotes values appropriate only to inferior people, values which are
                damaging and opposed to superior people, which have a <b>master morality</b>.
            </li>
            <li>He encouraged us to live a life so full that we will not regret it, since, according to him, we will live it, identically, an infinite amount of
                times. This he called <b>the eternal recurrence</b>, or <q>the absolute and eternal repetition of all things in periodical cycles.</q> Such a
                life is the happy life, him defining happiness as <q>the feeling that power increases.</q> One instrument we can use to create such a life is
                <b>amor fati</b> — to love one's fate, with tragedy, suffering, and all: <q>The saying of yea to life, and even to its weirdest and most
                    difficult problems: the will to life rejoicing at its own infinite vitality in the sacrifice of its highest types—that is what I called
                    Dionysian, that is what I meant as the bridge to the psychology of the tragic poet. Not to cast out terror and pity, or to purge one's self
                    of dangerous passion by discharging it with vehemence,—this was Aristotle's misunderstanding of it,—but to be far beyond terror and pity and
                    to be the eternal lust of Becoming itself—that lust which also involves the joy of destruction." "The yea-saying to the impermanence and
                    annihilation of things [...]; the yea-saying to contradiction and war, the postulation of Becoming, together with the radical rejection
                    even of the concept Being.</q>
            </li>
            <li>One particular form of the Will to Power is what he calls <b>self-overcoming</b>. Here the Will to Power is harnessed and directed toward
                self-mastery and self-transformation, guided by the principle that <q>your real self lies not deep within you but high above you,</q> as
                Zarathustra bid us: <q>Lose me and find yourselves.</q> This is kinda similar with Jung's encouragement (Nietzsche makes it feel more noble):
            </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <p>There is only one way and that is your way. There is only one salvation and that is your salvation. Why are you looking for help? Do you believe
                help will come from outside? What is to come will be created in you and from you. Hence look into yourself. Do not compare. Do not measure. No
                other way is like yours. All other ways deceive and tempt you. You must fulfill the way that is in you.</p>

        <summary>Friedrich Nietzsche - The Birth of Tragedy</summary>
        <ul>
            <li><q>The sphere of poetry does not lie beyond this world as the fantastic impossibility of a poet's brain. It wants to be exactly the opposite,
                the unadorned expression of the truth, and it must therefore cast off the false costume of that truth thought up by the man of culture.</q></li>
            <li class="no-style-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Here I think he argues that it is hard for normal people (modern, cultural, educated, etc.) to see the truth because they have been
                        taught (and reinforced themselves as well) a lie — a different 'cultural' truth; therefore, it takes a lot of effort to undo that veil.
                        Also, he argues that truth is not only accessible to smart people, but to anyone that is willing to put in the work. In the same
                        paragraph: <q>The Dionysian Greek wants truth and nature in their highest power: he seems himself transformed into a satyr.</q> I think
                        he means that, to know the truth, you must become (not be afraid of, idolize, worship, etc.) the ideal person.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>So, you want knowledge, huh? You gotta pay. But don't worry, you'll find the reality of life <q>indestructibly powerful and delightful</q> and
                that will give you an Apollonian consolation.
            </li>
            <li><q>The pre-condition of this Prometheus myth is the extraordinary value which a naive humanity associates with fire as the true divine protector
                of that rising culture. But the fact that man freely controls fire and does not receive it merely as a gift from heaven, as a stirring lightning
                flash or warming rays of the sun, appeared to these contemplative primitive men as an outrage, a crime against divine nature. And so right there
                the first philosophical problem posed an awkward insoluble contradiction between man and god and pushed it right up to the door of that culture,
                like a boulder. The best and loftiest thing which mankind can share is achieved through a crime, and people must now accept the further
                consequences, namely, the entire flood of suffering and troubles with which the offended divine presences afflict the nobly ambitious human
                race. Such things must happen — an austere notion which, through the value which it gives to a crime, stands in a curious contrast to the
                Semitic myth of the Fall, in which curiosity, lying falsehoods, temptation, lust, in short, a row of predominantly female emotions are look upon
                as the origin of evil.</q>
            </li>
            <li class="no-style-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>I think this is a seed of his future <q>God is dead</q> quote. This means that, with every technological breakthrough that leads to a
                        change of perspective, we will kill God.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><q>However, without myth that culture forfeits its healthy creative natural power: only a horizon reorganized through myth completes the unity
                of an entire cultural movement.</q></li>
            <li class="no-style-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>So, you can only have an ultimate goal (ideal) which is very vague (<q>horizon reorganized through myth</q>) so that it leaves room for
                        change, for creativity.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Don't expose yourself to the unknown (Dionysian) constantly because you will not tolerate life. Veil yourself (lie to yourself, if you must say
                it like this) with Apollo and its beauties, so you can take the next step and experience the next moment. Why do this? Ha-ha, this is a
                Dionysian question that needs to be asked through an Apollonian lens, in which case it will not be asked anymore.
            </li>
            <li><q>But, you strange foreigner, how much must these people have suffered in order to be able to become so beautiful!</q>

                <ul>

            <li>If languages represented Truth, there wouldn't be these many. Language appoints the relation of things to humans.</li>
            <li>We don't know the laws of nature. We only see their relations with each other and add to them time and space, or <q>relations of succession and
                numbers.</q> Thus, we can't grasp Truth because, partly, everything we see is part of nature and we grasp everything in nature under our
                understanding of its laws: <q>Everything marvelous that we admire in the laws of nature and that promotes our explanation and could mislead us
                    into distrusting idealism, consists exclusively of the mathematical stringency and inviolability of time- and space-perceptions.</q>

            <li><q>That flight was not a world-flight in the sense of Indian philosophers; no deep religious conviction as to the depravity, transitoriness and
                accursedness of Existence demanded that flight — that ultimate goal, the rest in the 'Being,' was not striven after as the mystic absorption in
                one all-sufficing enrapturing conception which is a puzzle and a scandal to common men.</q>

        <ul>
            <li>Knowledge, not culture, wins a war. If you ascribe culture as a contributing factor to winning a war, you make it rotten because culture which
                doesn't stand against war is corrupt to begin with.
            </li>
            <li>Knowledge is a tool towards a purpose.</li>
            <li>Philistines sometimes enjoy art but separate it from real life — from their wives, jobs, etc. — so that art cannot affect their life.</li>
            <li>In philosophy, like in any work, one should start from the bottom — don't fly to the highest ideas without doing the grunt work of explaining
                first principles.
            </li>
            <li><q>It is, in short, the recognition of the fact that the two sides of his nature remained faithful to each other, that out of free and unselfish
                love, the creative, ingenuous, and brilliant side kept loyally abreast of the dark, the intractable, and the tyrannical side.</q>

                <ul>
                    <li>So, it's not about destroying your bad side, it's about keeping your good side better than your bad side.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><q>Improve each shining hour, turn it to some account and judge it as quickly as possible! One would think modern men had but one virtue left —
                presence of mind. Unfortunately, it much more closely resembles the omnipresence of disgusting and insatiable cupidity, and spying
                inquisitiveness become universal.</q>
            </li>
            <li class="no-style-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the source of security engineering: because people now only have cupidity over <i>nil admirari</i> and care of things eternal,
                        spying inquisitiveness becomes universal — security engineering is the answer to modern man's cupidity which is brought about, can be
                        argued, because of the lack of <i>nil admirari</i> and of a goal that focuses the mind on eternity (or, in any case, not on the
                        present).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><q>A struggle which never ceased until his evolution was complete.</q>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Myth is <q>the people's creation and their language of distress.</q>
            </li>
            <li><q>When all that is unnatural becomes self-conscious, it desires but one thing — nonentity; the natural thing, on the other hand, yearns to be
                transfigured through love: the former would fain not be, the latter would fain be otherwise.</q>

                <ul>
                    <li>Here he almost matches Nature with Existence. So, depression is the scream of something unnatural in us? Nature doesn't want to die? Of
                        course not, she MAKES suffering!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Knowledge needs to be alive. You can't express externally (talk or act) what is dead knowledge because if you would be able to then that would
                be knowledge that is alive. Having dead knowledge contributes to the chaos and disorder of your inner being.
            </li>
            <li>Truth is not useful. Look at monks. They seem (to me) to be better people than most; not because of their beliefs, precisely, but because they
                enacted them, because they followed a path and stuck to it. Science says we can't reach truth, only not reject a hypothesis. Philosophy and
                religion say the same thing in other terms. Show humility: admit that you can't know everything and stick to a path. I have a thirst for knowing
                stuff, and that is my path. The problem with this path is that I must make the rules myself. So be it.
            </li>
            <li>Having too much dead knowledge suffocates your character which will no longer express itself — so the modern man is a <q>compendia, abstractions
                made concrete.</q>
            </li>
            <li>Don't use knowledge to tell you what to feel (to alter your nature). Trust your nature. So then, what is the purpose of acquiring knowledge?
                Close to altering your nature and, at the same time, not: acquire knowledge to beautify your nature. Knowledge that is alive gives a form to
                your character and adds substance to that form too. To put this in modern terms: knowledge is used to help inform you about a problem which,
                ultimately, YOU must solve. In modern terms, knowledge that is alive is a SKILL.
            </li>
            <li>Be careful not to honor knowledge above life, for knowledge serves life — it tells you how you should act IN life. So, don't do anything when
                you're depressed except for trying to get out of it because everything that you read while depressed will serve no purpose or will build towards
                a bigger hate of life, everything that you think will have the undertones of hate, from which seed can spring only bad stuff. You can write
                though, I think, while suffering. NOT while hating!
            </li>
            <li><q>Everything in the process of 'becoming' is a hollow sham, contemptible and shallow: man can only find the solution of his riddle in 'being'
                something definite and unchangeable.</q>
            </li>
            <li class="no-style-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>You must live as something defined 'cause otherwise you're nothing — therefore you need to have rules, to be consistent, to follow
                        something. You do not need a purpose in life, you need a function for it. Therefore, you cannot become something that you are not lest
                        you will be shallow. So, know thyself!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You can't use other people's opinions to discover yourself. You will see in yourself only those opinions as a consequence.</li>
        </ul>

        <summary>Friedrich Nietzsche - Human, All Too Human</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no absolute Truth because everything is evolving. An absolute Truth implies something unchangeable, static. This is not the case with
                humans. Yeah but this only means that an absolute Truth may exist outside and regardless of humans.
            </li>
            <li>Bad habit in reasoning: an opinion brings happiness; therefore, it is the true opinion. Its effect is good; therefore, it is itself good and
                true. Reversed this would mean that an opinion which brings pain, and which effects a bad thing is false and bad. Maybe this is why I don't
                enjoy being happy, because I know it is not necessarily true and because I feel am farther from Truth than when suffering. Nevertheless, now
                that I learned that Truth cannot be reached (at least by me in this lifetime) because, as far as we know, it doesn't exist, I can enjoy myself
                more.
            </li>
            <li>It is okay to have sweetmeats and playthings if you have a good goal that demands severity and self-restraint; without them you will be morose.
            </li>
            <li>Encourage curiosity in your philosophy by leaving it incomplete, so that the reader can wonder and continue the work.</li>
            <li>You usually are ill because of your job or society; because of them you have lost self-possession. Find the balance between working for others'

            <li>Paul, the founder of Christianity, made his religion because he wanted to destroy the Jewish law (frustrated because he couldn't fulfill it) and
                found in Christ the perfect means to this goal.
            </li>
            <li>We use rules to automate (remove thinking from) the way towards a goal. Rules distract our attention from their fundamental aim. Just like a man
                is more careful with his health when the doctor is not around and is more reckless when he is under medical observation.

            <li>If you want ecstatic feelings, high enjoyment, new levels of happiness, you must also be willing to support the greatest possible amount of
                pain. If you don't want pain, you will also receive the least amount of pleasure.
            </li>
            <li>Pain is good. We think it bad because it brings displeasure, but displeasure is necessary for greatness. Strive for the greatness and see
                suffering as the joyous thing you must travel through to it.

            <li>There are no universal virtues. They are <q>an expression of the decay, the last collapse of life.</q> We must make our own virtues, according
                to the <q>most profound laws of self-preservation and of growth.</q> Virtues must <q>spring out of <i>our</i> personal need and defence.</q>
            </li>
            <li>He defined consciousness, or <q>the spirit,</q> as a <q>symptom of a relative imperfection of the organism, as an experiment, a groping, a
                misunderstanding, as an affliction which uses up nervous force unnecessarily—we deny that anything can be done perfectly so long as it is done
                consciously.</q> If we <q>take away the nervous system and the senses</q>, then <q>the rest is miscalculation.</q>
            </li>
            <li>When you are going on a downward spiral, when your will to power decreases, when you are mentally weak, <q>there is always an accompanying
                decline physiologically, a <i>décadence</i>.</q>
            </li>
            <li><b>Why I am attracted to the devil (maybe, partly, ... all qualifications here):</b>
                <q>The same instinct which prompts the inferior to reduce their own god to "goodness-in-itself" also prompts them to eliminate all good
                    qualities from the god of their superiors; they make revenge on their masters by making a devil of the latter's god.</q>
            </li>
            <li>The loftier you make an idea you also tend to make it <q>ever thinner and paler.</q> That image we have of an angel soaring into the sky,
                becoming pure light, becoming everything (a system of thought, a religion), and finally disappearing? What use have we of something which
                disappeared or of something which represents everything? We need precise, strong, earthly, well-fed ideas!
            </li>
            <li>Pilate, Nietzsche thinks, is the only honourable character in the Gospels. The only valuable words in the New Testament are his: <q>What is
                truth?</q>
            </li>
            <li>Nietzsche defines lying as <q>to refuse to see what one sees, or to refuse to see it <i>as</i> it is</q> and attributes it as the first
                requisite for a party man.
            </li>
            <li>He defines a conviction as <q>a falsehood that becomes a matter of principle <i>because</i> it serves a purpose</q> and ponders if lying is not
                an embryonic form of conviction.

        <ul>
            <li><i>Taste</i> is the popular word for the instinct of self-preservation that empowers acts of choosing one's <q>diet, locality, climate, and
                one's mode of recreation, the whole casuistry of self-love.</q> This is defensive — guarding against bad taste. The small defensive acts take a
                lot of energy. This can deplete one: <q>When he has not a book between his fingers he cannot think. When he thinks, he responds to a stimulus (a
                    thought he has read),—finally all he does is to react.</q> This leaves the scholar exhausted <q>in saying either 'yes' or 'no' to matter
                    which has already been thought out, or in criticising it—he is no longer capable of thought on his own account.</q> This exhaustion leads to
                decay: <q>In him the instinct of self-defence has decayed, otherwise he would defend himself against books.</q> This decay leads to
                disinterestedness — man will ingest anything; he will become full of not-himself and thus empty: <q>In the concepts 'disinterestedness' and
                    'self-denial,' the actual signs of decadence are to be found.</q>
            </li>
            <li>For Nietzsche, man needs to <q>never have spared himself, he must have been hard in his habits, in order to be good-humoured and merry among a
                host of inexorable truths.</q>
            </li>
            <li>He sees a <b>free spirit</b> as a <q>spirit that has become free, that has once more taken possession of itself.</q>
            </li>
            <li>Nietzsche realized that he was stuck in a rut and got free by ceasing <q>for years [...] from reading</q> which was <q>the greatest boon I ever
                conferred upon myself!</q>
            </li>
            <li>The first condition of a creative act, <q>of every act which proceeds from the most intimate, most secret, and most concealed recesses of a
                man's being,</q> is the <q>expenditure of all defensive forces.</q> <q>I even think it probable that one does not digest so well, that one is
                less willing to move, and that one is much too open to sensations of coldness and suspicion; for, in a large number of cases, suspicion is
                merely a blunder in etiology.</q>
            </li>
            <li><q>The psychological problem presented by the type of Zarathustra is, how can he, who in an unprecedented manner says no, and <i>acts</i> no, in
                regard to all that which has been affirmed hitherto, remain nevertheless a yea-saying spirit? how can he who bears the heaviest destiny on
                his shoulders and whose very life-task is a fatality, yet be the brightest and the most transcendental of spirits—for Zarathustra is a dancer?
                how can he who has the hardest and most terrible grasp of reality, and who has thought the most 'abysmal thoughts,' nevertheless avoid
                conceiving these things as objections to existence, or even as objections to the eternal recurrence of existence?—how is it that on the contrary
                he finds reasons for <i>being himself</i> the eternal affirmation of all things, 'the tremendous and unlimited saying of Yea and Amen'?... 'Into
                every abyss do I bear the benediction [i.e. a short invocation for divine help, blessing and guidance, usually after a church worship service]
                of my yea to Life.' ... But this, once more, is precisely the idea of Dionysus.</q>

            <li>The image of the redeemer is the child because, after destroying the old, you need to start anew, as/like a child.</li>
            <li>The mandala is <q>formation, transformation, the eternal mind's eternal recreation.</q> They are <q>cryptograms on the state of [...] self.</q>
            </li>
            <li>The self is <q>the wholeness of the personality, which, when everything is well, is harmonious, but which can bear no self deception.</q>
                It is also <q>the principle and archetype of orientation and meaning.</q>
            </li>
            <li>In him, Jung had the <b>spirit of the time</b>, concentrated on <q>use and value,</q> and the <b>spirit of the depths</b>, <q>which led to the
                things of the soul,</q> and which <q>rules the depths of everything contemporary.</q> From Faust: <q>What you call the spirit of the times is
                fundamentally the gentleman's own mind, in which the times are reflected.</q> The spirit of the time <q>changes with the generations</q> whereas
                the spirit of the depths <q>from time immemorial and for all the future possesses a greater power than the spirit of this time.</q>
                <q>The spirit of the depths has subjugated all pride and arrogance to the power of judgement</q> for the <q>melting together of sense and
                    nonsense</q> which <q>produces the supreme meaning.</q> Both are necessary: <q>The spirit of this time is ungodly, the spirit of the depths
                    is ungodly, balance is godly.</q>
            </li>
            <li>Jung said that not all people have to know themselves. The shadow of the image of God is as big as the image itself and some people need the
                shadow. But, his spirit of the depths then said that: <q>No one can or should halt sacrifice. Sacrifice is not destruction, [...] [it is the]
                    foundation stone of what is to come.</q>
            </li>
            <li>Following my own way, I feel, will be very lonely: <q>The one eye of the Godhead is blind, the one ear of the Godhead is deaf, the order of its
                being is crossed by chaos.</q> As in, <q>let each of them stand apart, so that each may find his own fellowship and love it.</q> However, this
                is necessary, as an instinct in myself is telling me, and Jung expresses better: <q>Laws and teaching held in common compel people to solitude,
                    so that they may escape the pressure of undesirable contact, but solitude makes people hostile and venomous.</q> Because of this venom I
                have to run away in myself.
            </li>
            <li><q>The Gods love perfection because it is the total way of life. But the Gods are not with him who wishes to be perfect, because he is an
                imitation of perfection.</q>

            </li>
            <li><q>If I thus truly imitate Christ, I do not imitate anyone, I emulate no one, but go my own way, and I will also no longer call myself a
                Christian. Initially, I wanted to emulate and imitate Christ by living my life, while observing his precepts. A voice in me protested against
                this and wanted to remind me that my time also had its prophets who struggle against the yoke with which the past burdens us. I did not succeed
                in uniting Christ with the prophets of this time. The one demands bearing, the other discarding; the one commands submission, the other the
                will. How should I think of this contradiction without doing injustice to either? What I could not conjoin in my mind probably lends itself to
                living one after the other.</q>

                    <li>I think he just brought his balance to an ultimatum. Regarding everything spiritual, mystical, the unknown: only be interested enough in
                        it so that you understand what is happening, what are you experiencing, what are you living, even though you cannot comprehend it. Some
                        things we cannot understand, some animals we cannot tame — however, it is our duty to be aware of them: stay inside if there are wolves
                        outside, but be able to kill them if they attack. Or, at least, know what killed you. He compresses all of this elegantly in the
                        sentence <q>May man rule in the human world.</q> He seems to follow this with an advice for your soul, which I will extend to the God
                        too: <q>The excess of your rage, your doubt, and your love belong to her, but only the excess. If you give her this excess, humanity
                            will be saved from the nightmare.</q> The seed of these sentences, to me, is: only invest into the things not of daily life your
                        left over energy propelled by curiosity, respect, love, and probably other things. Making this your entire life is not healthy, for you
                        can become a scholar, hermit, etc., extremes which cannot be referred to as men who have experienced it all — whole men (holy men) — but
                        as specialized men.

            <li>The microservices architecture trades development complexity for operational complexity.</li>
            <li>Kubernetes needs a lot of info up front so it can manage the resources automatically and make intelligent decisions.</li>
            <li>You can check the liveness and readiness of a Pod by sending an HTTP GET request and checking for a 200-399 response code, or by sending a TCP
                Socket probe and expecting a successful connection, or by executing arbitrary code and expecting a 0 exit code. The corrective action of the
                liveness probe is a Pod restart and that of a readiness probe is the removal from the Service endpoint so the Pod will not be accessed if it's
                not ready.
            </li>
            <li>Containerized apps don't control their lifecycle. This was handed over to Kubernetes. This abstraction removes the need for application-specific
                lifecycle management. Less code to take care of.
            </li>
            <li>Watch out for Defer containers, the opposite of Init containers. Coming soon to a cluster near you.</li>
            <li>At the moment, Cluster Autoscaling is very experimental. Even its concept still implies manual configuration of nodes that may be used later for
                scaling up; a form of hot stand-by. I'm curious if this Kubernetes feature can be extended with a meta, self-aware agent that will search for
                potential nodes to assimilate.
