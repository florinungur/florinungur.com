        <li>In Soviet Russia they used to make pupils write 12 pages of text without writing or grammar mistakes... in 2 languages: Russian AND Ukranian.</li>
        <li>Quality means perfection for Alexander. He takes the "hero" perspective of pushing quality to its most extreme limit (because quality is usually
            seen as a spectrum tending towards lack of flaws).

        <li>Alexander used to know at least 1000 poems by heart.</li>

        <li>For Jung, all religious ideas ale equally valid as expressions of human psychic life. Also, all religious "truths" and objects are simply
            psychological.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Maybe this is connected with Nietzsche's claim that all philosophers do is articulate their being through their writing, not discovering
                absolute truths.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>For Jung, the knowledge of God is self-knowledge. Kinda like for Jesus: <q>the kingdom of God is within you.</q>

        <li><b>The living being vs. the rational being</b>: The living being does things to continue living as its top priority, the rational being does not
            keep the same top priority. Nietzsche believed that people are not rational (philosophers included).
        </li>
        <li>Nietzsche thought that every philosopher is articulating their being through their writing, not discovering absolute truths — not thinking, but
            revealing (like a story).
        </li>
        <li><b>The nascent form of the Will to Power</b>: <q>For every impulse is imperious, and as such, attempts to philosophize.</q>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Nietzsche says that these impulses/instincts are alive and are trying to live (expand, climb the dominance/competence hierarchy), ergo
                dominate.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>There might be no distinction between climbing the social ladder and the Will to Power. But, Peterson asks, <q>power in relationship to what?</q>

    <ul>
        <li>Code generation can be used to set strict standards across systems.</li>
        <li><q>One programming language for every 4000 engineers.</q></li>
        <li>Starting with the API definition — which is seen as the backbone of the entire software system (excluding infrastructure) that a company provides
            and/or uses — allows for major system modifications (e.g. incorporating GDPR regulation) with a few language-neutral JSON/YAML/etc. line changes.
        </li>
        <li>If you start with the entire system being defined as an API you can store that API definition in Git (so you can revert back changes that would
            otherwise take more time to fix, collaborate, etc.) and do CI tasks on it: run linters, test the API, etc. For sure there are more pros and cons on
            this, like being able to understand how your system works without needing to look at MBs of code written in different programming languages (that
            you might not know). Cons? Not really a con, but: you still need to enforce code to only use defined interfaces to communicate with other
            services.
        </li>
        <li>The scenario described above defines the API specification as the (single?) source of truth for the system design. If, then, the system
            specification passes your tests (e.g. querying for a random user returns an error), you can also be sure that the system code passes those tests.
        </li>
        <li>It's language studies 101: the language you learn shapes how you think. In this case: the communication protocol you implement (the API definition)
            shapes your code.
        </li>

        <li>Start with a promise, cycle around the subject, build a fence (distinguish from similar ideas), ask a question to keep people engaged, and use
            verbal punctuation to allow people to get back on the train of ideas (e.g. enumerate, use seven-second breaks, and stress some words).
